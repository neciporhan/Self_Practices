Warm Up tasks:
    1. create a class called LeapYear, and write a program that can identify if the given is Leap Year, print true if it's leap year, otherwise print false
        Ex:
            year = 2020  ==> short;
            LeapYear =true/false;
        output:
            2020 is leap year: true
            Assume that any year that can be divisble by 4 is leap year
