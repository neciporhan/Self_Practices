task04:
            Create a class called SalaryCalculator, write a program that can calculate the taxt, and salary after tax based on the hourly rate & tax rates
                ex:
                    if: rate = 55;
                        stateTaxRate = 0.04;
                        federalTaxRate =0.22;
                        weeklyHours = 40;
                    then output will be:
                            your salary is: 105600 USD
                            your total tax is: 27456 USD
                            your income after tax is: 78144 USD
                Assume that a year has 48 weeks (excluding PTO)
